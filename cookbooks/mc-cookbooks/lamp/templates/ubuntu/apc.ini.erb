;Min memory of 64M for a very basic Drupal install.
;Review and adjust periodically the first few days and then every few months or 
;whenever dev changes are made.
apc.shm_size=128M
apc.shm_segments=1

;On production set to 0 for the best performance so APC doesn't check the file
;before caching it.
;While in active dev setting to 1 may be a better choice.
apc.stat=0

;Default 1 but if you want to use apc.filters set to 0. 
apc.cache_by_default=1

;Filter files, only used if apc.cache_by_default is disabled. Uses posix
;expression for files to include/ignore based on + and - signs, minus is the
;default. Uses comma separated file names and not absolute paths.
;e.g. Cache all files in "drupal-docroot" and ignore "apc.php" files.
;apc.filters = "+drupal-docroot,apc.php"

;Number of source files to be cached, review apc.php stats to adjust over time.
;default is 1000
apc.num_files_hint=8000
;default of 4096.
apc.user_entries_hint=8000

;Idle cache entry lifetime in seconds, 7200 = 2hrs
;Setting ttl to live to 0 means forever and an apache restart would be needed
;after each code update to clear the caches.

apc.user_ttl=600
apc.gc_ttl=600

;Defaults to 1M, if you profile you should note any heavy files.
apc.max_file_size=2M

;Enable upload progress, useful in Drupal.
apc.rfc1867=1

;Determin if your mmap'ed memory region is going to be file-backed or shared
;memory backed. Option 1 is the default but Option 2 is the most common.
;See http://www.php.net/manual/en/apc.configuration.php#ini.apc.mmap-file-mask
; Option 1 (default if not set)
;To mmap directly from /dev/zero, use:
;apc.mmap_file_mask=/dev/zero

; Option 2 (most common)
;Specify the location for file-backed memory storage file.
apc.mmap_file_mask=/tmp/apc.XXXXXX

;Option 3
;For POSIX-compliant shared-memory-backed mmap, use:
;apc.mmap_file_mask=/apc.shm.XXXXXX
